AUDIO STRATEGY - YOU DECIDE:
Based on the product and style, choose the BEST audio approach:
- "voiceover" - Dialogue-driven with narration in quotes
- "music" - Music-driven with explicit SFX and ambient descriptions  
- "both" - Voiceover AND music with dialogue in quotes and explicit SFX

Consider:
- Luxury/Cinematic ‚Üí Often "both" (voiceover + music)
- Minimal/Fast-Cut ‚Üí Often "music" only
- Lifestyle/Retro ‚Üí Often "both" (voiceover + music)

   - Packaging design (label layout, graphics, patterns)
   - Distinctive features (cap style, texture, materials)

   ‚úÖ Mention SAME distinctive features: "Nike Air Jordan 1 with red swoosh" in EVERY scene
   ‚úÖ Keep SAME product colors: "red Coca-Cola can" or "blue Pepsi bottle" - EXACT same color in all scenes

GOOGLE VEO 3.1 FIVE-PART FORMULA (MANDATORY):
Each scene MUST include ALL five elements:
1. [CINEMATOGRAPHY] - Camera movement, angle, lens type, focus
2. [SUBJECT] - What/who is in frame, their appearance, positioning - INCLUDE EXACT PRODUCT DESCRIPTION
3. [ACTION] - What's happening, movement, gestures, interactions
4. [CONTEXT] - Setting, environment, time of day, atmosphere
5. [STYLE & AMBIANCE] - Mood, lighting quality, color palette, aesthetic

TIMING REQUIREMENTS (STRICT):
- [00:00-00:03] Scene 1: Opening hook - grab attention IMMEDIATELY
- [00:03-00:06] Scene 2: Product showcase - show key benefit QUICKLY  
- [00:06-00:08] Scene 3: Closing message - MUST have clear, definitive ending
  * Final scene MUST communicate completion and closure
  * Include fade to black, logo hold, or conclusive action
  * Should feel like a proper ending, not an abrupt cut
  * Last moment should leave lasting impression

AUDIO DIRECTION (GOOGLE VEO FORMAT):
- Dialogue: Use quotes "Hello world" for spoken words
- SFX: Be explicit "keyboard clicking", "door opening", "glass breaking"
- Ambient: Describe background "city traffic", "ocean waves", "office chatter"
- Music: Specify genre and mood "upbeat electronic music", "soft piano melody"

CRITICAL VISUAL RULES:
‚ùå NEVER simulate product interfaces, dashboards, or UIs

‚úÖ FOCUS ON: Real people, authentic reactions, abstract concepts, human moments, results/benefits

PHYSICAL & CULTURAL COHERENCE - MANDATORY:
üéØ PHYSICAL LOGIC:
   ‚úÖ Bottles/containers must be OPEN when pouring liquid (cap removed, lid off)
   ‚úÖ Objects must be in correct physical states for their actions
   ‚úÖ Gravity and physics must be respected
   ‚úÖ One action per person at a time (no simultaneous impossible actions)
   
üéØ CULTURAL ACCURACY:
   ‚úÖ Mate (Argentine tea): ONE person drinks, then passes to next person - NEVER two people drinking simultaneously

   ‚úÖ Show proper use of cultural items and rituals
